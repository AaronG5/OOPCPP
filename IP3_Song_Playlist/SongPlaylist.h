// Structure of project:
// # SongPlaylist - represents a playlist used for storing 'Song' objects inside of its vector.
// # Song - represents a song that can be stored in 'SongPlaylist' instances.
// # SortingMethod - fully virtual class used as a base class for different methods of sorting the playlist.
// # SortByLength - method of sorting the playlist by song length using Tree Sort. Derived from 'SortingMethod'.
// # SortByTitle - method of sorting the playlist by song title using Gnome Sort. Derived from 'SortingMethod'.
// # SortByArtist - method of sorting the playlist by song artist. Derived from 'SortingMethod'. To be implemented by colleagues.

// Methods included in 'SongPlaylist':
// # Deep copy constructor
// # 'addSong' - adds a song to the playlist, automatically sorting it by the currently set sorting method.
// # 'removeSong' - removes a song from the playlist.
// # 'addSongToOtherPlaylist' - copies a song from one playlist to another.
// # 'setSortMethod' - set sort method which will be used to sort the playlist when calling 'sortPlaylist'.
// # 'sortPlaylist' - sort the playlist by the method set using 'setSortMethod'. If no sorting method is set, the method won't do anything.
// # 'operator[]' - returns a pointer to a song from the playlist by its index.
// # 'operator=' - assigment operator override.
// # 'getSong' - returns a pointer to a song from the playlist by its title.
// # 'getPlaylist' - returns the vector which stores all the songs.
// # 'getPlaylistInfo' - returns a formatted string of the contents of the playlist vector.

// NOTE: EVERY SONG TITLE IS ASSUMED TO BE UNIQUE
// It would be easy to resolve this issue by accessing Song objects by their unique ID instead, but 
// for easier and more readable testing, Song objects are accessed by their titles.
