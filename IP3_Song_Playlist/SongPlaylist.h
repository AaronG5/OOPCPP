// Structure of project:
// # SongPlaylist - represents a playlist used for storing 'Song' objects inside of its vector.
// # Song - represents a song that can be stored in 'SongPlaylist' instances.
// # CompareStrategy - fully virtual class used as a base class for deriving different ways of comparing songs to one another.
// # CompareByLength - method of comparing songs by their length. Derived from 'CompareStrategy'.
// # CompareByTitle - method of comparing songs by their title. Derived from 'CompareStrategy'.
// # CompareByArtist - method of comparing songs by their artist. Derived from 'CompareStrategy'. To be implemented by colleagues.
// # SortingAlgorithm - fully virtual class used as a base class for different sorting algorithms to sort the playlist.
// # TreeSort - a sorting algorithm based on binary search tree (BST). Derived from 'SortingAlgorithm`.
// # GnomeSort - a secondary sorting algorithm. Derived from 'SortingAlgorithm`.

// Methods included in 'SongPlaylist':
// # Deep copy constructor
// # 'addSong' - adds a song to the playlist, automatically sorting it by the currently set sorting method.
// # 'removeSong' - removes a song from the playlist.
// # 'addSongToOtherPlaylist' - copies a song from one playlist to another.
// # 'setSortMethod' - set sort method which will be used to sort the playlist when calling 'sortPlaylist'.
// # 'sortPlaylist' - sort the playlist by the method set using 'setSortMethod'. If no sorting method is set, the method won't do anything.
// # 'operator[]' - returns a pointer to a song from the playlist by its index.
// # 'operator=' - assigment operator override.
// # 'getSong' - returns a pointer to a song from the playlist by its title.
// # 'getPlaylist' - returns the vector which stores all the songs.
// # 'getPlaylistInfo' - returns a formatted string of the contents of the playlist vector.

// NOTE: EVERY SONG TITLE IS ASSUMED TO BE UNIQUE
// It would be easy to resolve this issue by accessing Song objects by their unique ID instead, but 
// for easier and more readable testing, Song objects are accessed by their titles.
